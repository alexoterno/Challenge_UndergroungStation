On the whole :
  - keras_classifier_2.py =  second version of our neural network in python
  - real_time_prediction_and_motion_detect_2.py =  second version of our
  prediction algorithm
  - bottleneck_fc_model.h5 = weights after trained our neural network
  - shuffle_img_(rotate).py = to shuffle and rotate the underground station frames
  - video2img.py = to extract frame from underground station videos
  - class_dictionary.json = name list of the underground station chosen
